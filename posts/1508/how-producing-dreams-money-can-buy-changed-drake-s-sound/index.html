But this changed with his second album, Take Care, where he began to move away from this formula and introduce more melodic and emotional elements to his production.</p><p>This departure of sound can be attributed to the influence of producer and songwriter, Noah 40 Shebib. 40 was brought on board to produce the majority of Take Care and introduced Drake to a sound that he hadn&rsquo;t really explored before. He created a mellower and more atmospheric soundscape, incorporating synths and unconventional samples that gave the album its unique flavor.</p><p>In addition to 40&rsquo;s production, the contributions of other producers such as Boi-1da and T-Minus helped to solidify Drake&rsquo;s newfound sound. By synthesizing the rap elements of his earlier work with the melodic, atmospheric production of 40 and his team, Drake was able to create a distinct sound that resonated with a wider audience.</p><p>Overall, 40 and his team of producers have played a huge role in shaping Drake&rsquo;s sound and helping him to become one of the most successful rappers of the modern era. By helping him create the dream sound of Take Care, Drake was able to set himself apart from his contemporaries and set the tone for many of his future recordings.</p><h3 id=2-reflection-of-drakes-evolving-sound>2.
