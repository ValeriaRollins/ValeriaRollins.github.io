All relevant documents must also be enclosed with the Claim Form, such as birth certificate, bank account details, rent bond agreement, etc.</p><p>Once the Claim Form has been lodged, the relevant government department will begin the process of tracing the missing funds. If the funds are found, the claimant will be contacted and asked to provide further proof of identity. Once this proof has been verified, the unclaimed money will be paid directly into the claimant&rsquo;s bank account.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that there are time limits for claiming money in South Australia, which vary depending on the source of the unclaimed funds. It is therefore essential for individuals to stay up to date with the relevant time limits for any unclaimed funds that they are entitled to.
